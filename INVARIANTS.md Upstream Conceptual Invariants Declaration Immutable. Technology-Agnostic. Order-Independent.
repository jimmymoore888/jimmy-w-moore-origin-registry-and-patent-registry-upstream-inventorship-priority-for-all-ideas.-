Upstream Conceptual Invariants Declaration
Immutable. Technology-Agnostic. Order-Independent.

====================================================================

PURPOSE

This document defines the non-negotiable conceptual invariants governing
the ideas, systems, and frameworks originating from this repository.

These invariants describe properties that must remain true across all
implementations, adaptations, optimizations, substitutions, or derivative
works—regardless of technology, medium, era, or execution environment.

If an implementation preserves these invariants, it operates within the
conceptual territory defined here.

If an implementation violates or removes any invariant, it exits that
territory entirely.

====================================================================

SCOPE

These invariants apply to, but are not limited to:

- Authentication systems
- Identity systems
- Security primitives
- Interaction-based verification mechanisms
- Dynamic input or challenge systems
- Any system claiming resistance to replay, observation, or static capture

No specific technology is required or assumed.

Technologies are replaceable.
Invariants are not.

====================================================================

INVARIANT 1 — NON-REPLAYABILITY

A valid interaction, credential, or authentication outcome cannot be replayed
to produce the same result.

- No static recording (video, audio, memory, data capture, transcript)
  may be reused successfully.
- Validity arises from conditions that cannot be identically reproduced.

Any system allowing successful replay violates this invariant.

====================================================================

INVARIANT 2 — DYNAMIC INPUT SPACE

The effective input space is not fixed.

- Inputs may change over time, state, context, ordering, or interaction.
- Symbols, representations, or interfaces may shift, rotate, mutate, or
  re-express without repeating deterministically.
- The user does not interact with a static keyboard, static sequence,
  or static symbol map.

Static input systems violate this invariant.

====================================================================

INVARIANT 3 — OBSERVATION RESISTANCE

Observation does not meaningfully reduce system security.

- Watching a valid interaction does not enable reconstruction.
- Recording a valid interaction does not enable reproduction.
- Exposure does not provide deterministic advantage.

This applies equally to:
- Human observers
- Automated systems
- Machine learning models
- Computational or quantum analysis

If observation materially improves success probability, this invariant
is violated.

====================================================================

INVARIANT 4 — STATE-DEPENDENT VALIDITY

Validity depends on live state, not pre-existing knowledge.

- Correctness cannot be established solely by knowing "the answer".
- Validity emerges from interaction with current system state.
- Past correctness does not guarantee future correctness.

Systems based on memorization alone violate this invariant.

====================================================================

INVARIANT 5 — IMPLEMENTATION INDEPENDENCE

No specific implementation detail is required to satisfy these invariants.

- Cryptographic primitives are optional.
- Tokens (including NFTs) are optional.
- Hardware devices are optional.
- Network connectivity is optional.
- Any specific protocol is optional.

Substituting technologies does not escape these invariants if the
conceptual properties remain intact.

====================================================================

INVARIANT 6 — NON-EXHAUSTIBILITY

The interaction space cannot be exhaustively enumerated in advance.

- Brute force enumeration is infeasible by design.
- Precomputation does not collapse future validity.
- The possibility space does not converge.

Any system whose space can be fully rolled out or precomputed violates
this invariant.

====================================================================

INVARIANT 7 — UPSTREAM / DOWNSTREAM SEPARATION

This repository defines conceptual territory, not execution.

- Downstream implementations may vary.
- Performance, UX, cost, and embodiment are downstream concerns.
- Authority over invariants remains upstream.

No downstream implementation may redefine these invariants without
exiting the defined conceptual space.

====================================================================

INVARIANT 8 — MODIFICATION NON-ESCAPE

Partial modification does not negate applicability.

- Changing symbols does not escape invariants.
- Changing representations does not escape invariants.
- Changing percentages, parameters, or surface features does not escape
  invariants.

A modification that preserves invariant behavior remains within scope.
A modification that violates any invariant exits the scope entirely.

====================================================================

INVARIANT 9 — AUTHORSHIP PRESERVATION

Any system, derivative, or implementation that materially relies on
these invariants must preserve attribution to the upstream origin.

- Removal of attribution constitutes attribution erosion.
- Attribution erosion does not invalidate origin.
- Origin remains upstream regardless of downstream omission.

====================================================================

INVARIANT 10 — NON-TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY

Use of these invariants does not transfer authorship, authority, or
legitimacy.

- Authority remains singular and upstream.
- Derivation does not imply ownership.
- Recognition does not imply endorsement.

====================================================================

DECLARATION

These invariants are declared as upstream, canonical, and immutable.

They define conceptual territory, not a product, not a protocol,
and not an implementation.

Any claim of independence that preserves these invariants is a derivative.
Any claim of novelty that violates them is a separate concept.

====================================================================
