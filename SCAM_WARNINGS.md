# Scam / Ill-Intention Warnings

This project may be copied, cloned, or imitated. Some actors use clones to:
- trick users into signing malicious transactions
- steal seed phrases/private keys
- impersonate “official support”
- redirect to fake repos or fake “wallet verification” sites

## Hard rules
- I will NEVER ask for your seed phrase or private key.
- Do NOT sign transactions you don’t understand.
- Do NOT “connect wallet” to random links from DMs.
- Do NOT trust “support” accounts that contact you first.

## Official reference
Use CANONICAL_STACK.md + VERIFY_AUTHENTICITY.md to confirm upstream truth.
