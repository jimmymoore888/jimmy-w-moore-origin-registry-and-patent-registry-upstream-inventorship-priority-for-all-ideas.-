# ORIGIN AND INVENTORSHIP DECLARATION

This repository constitutes the canonical, upstream record of origination,
inventorship, and priority for the ideas, systems, and conceptual frameworks
documented herein.

This record exists to establish authorship, prevent attribution erosion,
and provide a verifiable point of reference for downstream implementations,
derivatives, licenses, disclosures, or patent filings.

## INVENTOR

Primary Inventor and Originator:
J. Moore (also known as Jimmy W. Moore)

All ideas documented in this repository originate from the above individual
unless explicitly stated otherwise.

No implied co-authorship, joint inventorship, or shared origin is granted
by exposure, discussion, review, or downstream implementation.

---

## SCOPE OF IDEAS COVERED

This repository governs origination and priority for, including but not limited to:

- RagTuff (constraint-first, non-executing runtime and governance framework)
- Experiential systems and game mechanics derived from moral, karmic, or
  consequence-compression models
- Dynamic, non-replayable authentication and password-replacement primitives
- Cryptographic, NFT-based, or pattern-evolving input systems
- Any future systems documented, classified, or staged within this repository

This list is non-exhaustive. Inclusion is determined by documentation presence,
not by public awareness.

## PRIORITY AND TIMESTAMP

The commit history of this repository serves as a public, immutable timestamp
establishing priority of conception and disclosure.

This repository may be referenced in:
- Provisional or non-provisional patent filings
- Defensive publications
- Licensing discussions
- Academic or technical attribution
- Legal determinations of inventorship

---

## ATTRIBUTION AND DERIVATION

Any implementation, derivative work, system, or publication that materially
relies on ideas documented here must acknowledge origination from this source.

Attribution does not grant rights, licenses, or authority.
Lack of attribution does not negate origination.

---

## NO LICENSE GRANTED

This declaration does not grant any license, patent right, or permission to use.
All rights are reserved unless explicitly granted in a separate, written agreement.

---

## INTENT

This document is declarative, not performative.
It introduces no execution, no control, and no obligation.

Its sole function is to preserve truth of origin.
