## Authenticity + Anti-Impersonation Notice

This repo is a public reference model and verification hub for the canonical upstream projects:
- RagTuff (law / invariants)
- Near-Intersect (factory / execution)

### What is NOT authorized
We do not authorize:
- impersonation of the project, founder, or “official support”
- lookalike repos/domains meant to mislead users
- redistribution of our code/spec text in violation of the applicable license terms
- modified builds that are presented as “official”
- links that request seed phrases, private keys, remote access, or unknown transaction signatures

### Enforcement (measured + real)
We reserve all rights and will pursue appropriate remedies where applicable, including takedowns and legal action for:
- copyright/license violations (direct copying of protected text/code),
- fraudulent misrepresentation / impersonation,
- trademark/branding misuse (where applicable),
- malicious or deceptive distribution.

### Independent implementations
Independent re-implementations may exist. They are **not endorsed** unless they are clearly identified as third-party and do not misrepresent origin or official status.

### Report suspected impersonation or malicious links
If you see a suspicious repo/link claiming to be “official,” do not interact with it.
Verify using `VERIFY_AUTHENTICITY.md`, and report it via an Issue in this repo with screenshots/URLs.
