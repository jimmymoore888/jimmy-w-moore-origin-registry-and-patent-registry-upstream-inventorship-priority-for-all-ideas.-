# RECOGNIZED ADD-ONS AND EXTERNAL SYSTEMS

This document defines how RagTuff and related systems acknowledge external
technologies, services, or platforms without dependency, endorsement, or
transfer of inventorship.

Recognition is informational only.

## NON-DEPENDENCY STATEMENT (MANDATORY)

RagTuff does not require, depend upon, embed, bundle, or endorse any listed
external system.

Recognition indicates interface compatibility or conceptual adjacency only.

No listed system is necessary for RagTuff to function.
No listed system gains implied authority, endorsement, or priority.

## ATTRIBUTION AND ORIGIN PROTECTION

All core concepts, architectures, and governing principles remain attributed
to the original inventor as declared in ORIGIN.md.

Recognition of external systems does not:
- Transfer inventorship
- Grant co-authorship
- Create implied partnership
- Permit derivative claims over core designs

### Authentication Providers
Systems capable of interfacing with RagTuff-compatible identity primitives.

### Infrastructure Providers
Hosting, networking, or compute environments capable of running compatible
implementations.

### Cryptographic or Ledger Systems
Blockchains, ledgers, or verification layers capable of non-custodial
interaction.

### Game or Simulation Engines
